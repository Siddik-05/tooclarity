transduced =convert variations in (a physical quantity) into an electrical signal, or vice versa.



distortion = the act of twisting or altering something out of its true, natural, or original state 



minimum threshold = 12 FPS to perceive objects continuous motion. Below 12FPS objects continuous motion not appears, individual frames appears not continuous motion. (so 8FPS is false)



at 100FPS, display not appears continuous bcoz frames get escaped at that speed, so u see discontinuity.



pupil tracking done in vario headsets = flated rendering.



most imp component in tracking systems in modern HMDs = IMU (inertial measurement unit)
